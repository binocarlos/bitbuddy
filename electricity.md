# electricity

The world is not perfect - if it was, there would always be the right number of electrons for the number of protons and neutrons.

Electrons work very hard and fast to try and balance themselves fairly amoungst atoms but sometimes it just does not work out.

## evaporation

Once it has rained - have you noticed that it doesn't take long and the water has all dried up again.

That is because the water is 'evaporating' which means it's turning into gas and floating up into the sky.

It is still water (2 Hydrogen + 1 Oxygen) just not in liquid form.

## ions

Sometimes - as the water is turning to gas and floating up into the sky - electrons are left behind.

This creates an 'ion' which is an atom or molecule with the wrong number of electrons.

For electrons this is a disaster - remember they are working hard to be fair and share themselves between all the atoms.

## magnets

The electrons are all negitively charged and the protons are all positively charged.

Now we have a water molecule floating in the air with an electron missing - we can call it a 'positive' water ion.

Back down on the ground - there will be an atom somewhere with an extra electron.

Remember that electrons are negatively charged and so the one back on earth is called a 'negative' ion.

## potential

So, there are 2 ions now - one floating in the sky with a positive charge (because it lacks an electron) and the other on the ground with a negative charge (it has gained an electron).

This is known as an 'electrical potential' which you could call 'an unfairness of electrons'.

## voltage

Another word for this 'potential' or 'unfairness between 2 places' is voltage.

As more and more positive water ions float up into the sky - the voltage between that cloud and the earth increases.

Like sharing out sweets unfairly - you have to compare 2 points to measure voltage.

Saying 'they have 100 sweets' is not unfair until you say aswell 'and I only have 2' - voltage is the measurement of unfairness between 2 points.

## electricity

Electricity is what happens when the electrons find a way to balance themselves amoungst protons again.

In the sky, there are so many positive water ions that are missing an electron that the voltage between there and the earth, which has lots of electrons, has grown to a few million volts.

To compare how powerful that is - a single AA battery is 1.5 volts so its about a million AA batteries.

## resistance

For the electricity to happen and for the ions to equalize - the electrons need a path to travel down.

Whether something is good at allowing the extra electrons to travel (on top of their normal ones) is known as it's 'conductivity'.

If something is not very conductive (like plastic) then it has a high resistance.

The air between the earth and the positive water ions in the sky has a very high resistance - it will not allow extra electrons to pass easily.

## lightning

For the electrons to travel through material like air with a very high resistance - the voltage must be huge.

This is what happens when lightning strikes.  If air were like metal and was conductive - the ions would constantly equalize and the voltage would never grow for the lightning to happen.

As it is, air is not very conductive and so the voltage required for the electrons to 'leap' through air is very high.

That is why circuit boards in computers use Copper for the electricity to flow down - it makes it easy for the electricity to happen.

## communications

Lightning is not all that useful although it is cool.

If lightning happened every time there was going to be an earthquake however - it would be saving lives.

That is how humans have learnt to use electricity for computing - by turning it into a light-speed communications tool.
