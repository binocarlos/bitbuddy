Atoms are the raw ingredients for all of the stuff you see around you.

They combine with each other to make more interesting things called 'Molecules'.

## ingredients

Atoms and molecules are like raw ingredients for a chef.

The chef will use heat to combine these ingredients into something more interesting (yum).

Chemistry is the same thing really - in fact many great chefs approach cooking like chemistry!

The recipe for water? 2 Hydrogen atoms with 1 Oxygen atom

## atomic numbers

The character of each atom is decided by it's atomic number.  This means how many 'protons' and 'neutrons' are in the middle of the atom.

The simplest atom, Hydrogen has only 1 of each.

Complicated elements like Iron have many more.  You can see these numbers in the [the periodic table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table).

## electrons

The electrons are very far away from the protons and neutrons in the 'middle'.

The cool thing about electrons is that they are not fussy about which atom they belong to.

Take a room full of people with each person breathing air.

On each breath a person takes, the air becomes part of them for a moment (breath in, breath out).

A few moments later - that same air is a part of another person close by - the air is fair and it doesn't care!

## fairness

Electrons are similar - they will happily travel between atoms and they do it very quickly (the speed of light to be exact).

Atoms do not notice that any particular electron was actually with another atom a moment before - they just cannot tell.

You can test this - touch the wall with your finger.

BOOM - huge numbers of electrons from the wall just swapped with the ones in your finger.

If the protons and neutrons had swapped, you would have wall on your finger and finger on the wall.
