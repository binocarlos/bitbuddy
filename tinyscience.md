Atoms are the raw ingredients for all of the stuff you see around you.

Air, water and even chocolate is all made of atoms.

They combine with each other to make molecules.

Molecules combine with each other to make all the interesting stuff in the world.

## ingredients

The same is true for the raw ingredients a chef will use to make some yummy food.

They use heat to combine basic ingredients into something more interesting (yum).

Many great chefs approach cooking just like chemistry because really, they are the same thing.

The recipe for water? 2 Hydrogen atoms with 1 Oxygen atom.

## atomic numbers

The character of each atom is decided by it's atomic number.

This means how many 'protons' are in the middle of the atom.

Protons are made of smaller quantum particles and they have a 'positive' electrical charge.

## neutrons

Alongside the protons, in the center of the atom are neutrons.

Neutrons are made of different, smaller quantum particles and they don't have any electrical charge.

## nuclear

The protons and neutrons are bound to each other with a very strong nuclear force.

A nuclear bomb uses this force when it 'splits' an atom.  This releases some of this very powerful energy as heat and light.

## Higgs Boson

The Higgs Boson is 'everywhere' - even in deep space where there are no atoms (known as a 'vacuum') - the Higgs is there.

The protons and neutrons in the middle of atoms interact with the Higgs boson to gain 'weight'.

## gravity

The more protons and neutrons in an atom - the more it interacts with the Higgs Boson and so the more it weighs.

That is why Iron, which has 26 protons and 30 neutrons, weighs more than the simplest atom, Hydrogen, which has only 1 proton and 1 neutron.

Gravity is the attraction of things with weight to each other.

Saying something is heavy is like saying it has a high gravitational pull.

Everything falls to the earth because it is heavier than what is falling.

## electrons

Electrons do not interact with the Higgs Boson and so do not weigh anything.

They whizz around the place at light speed (literally) and you cannot really say they are in any given place at any given time.

When you see diagrams of atoms with electrons in a single place - that never actually happens.

Those diagrams represent the 'average' position of electrons - the electrons themselves are constantly in motion.

## electromagnetism

What controls where electrons go is protons.

That is because the electron and the proton form the 2 opposite ends of a magnet.

Protons have a positive electrical charge and electrons a negative electrical charge.

With magnets, opposites attract and so the electrons and protons are always trying to balance out.

## fairness

Because of this magnetic attraction, the mission of electrons is to be as fair as possible - they are always trying to have 1 electron next to 1 proton.

If you have 1 proton and 2 electrons - there is an overall negative charge.

The moment a spare proton appears - 1 of the electrons will leave and join the spare proton.

Sometimes however - the electrons do not manage to get themselves next to one proton each.

Humans have learned to create this lack of electrons and turn it into electricity, which is the next section.
